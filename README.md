# Trade Assistant

Trade Assistant is a custom multi-timeframe MT4/MT5 indicator coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator is based on an earlier version by Tom Balfe. It features four clear signals for each selected timeframe: stochastic, RSI, CCI entry, and CCI trend.

Trade Assistant supports all types of alerts and will let you know once there is a confluence of signals on any of the enabled timeframes.
